# Urban-AI-2025-Contest

This repository is intended to provide instructions to replicate results for the Urban AI 2025 Contest submission "XGBoost with physics-informed features and residual
regressor for the SBCS benchmark" (submission link provided once available).

The files are located in the 'src' folder. To replicate the results, please download the 'main.ipynb' notebook and the 'physics_informed_models_new_version.pkl' in the same folder. To reproduce the main and ensemble results, please run the last cell of the notebook. To reproduce the plots or the entire workflow, please run the cells above. The 'other.ipynb' contains initial analysis, including the reproduction of the adjacent room layout. For questions, please reach out to v.pyltsov@columbia.edu.
